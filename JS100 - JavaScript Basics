Reading Documentation 1

1. What is an excellent destination when looking for JavaScript documentation?

The JavaScript pages on MDN are a valuable resource that you should reference frequently as you learn JavaScript. They provide both tutorials and a reference of JavaScript's built-in objects and their properties and methods, operators, and more. You can also find information about browser compatibility and specifications.

2. Find out whether JavaScript has a method to lowercase a string, for example converting 'Aloha, World!' into 'aloha, world!.

'Aloha, World!'.toLowerCase(); // 'aloha, world!'

3. Is there a method to capitalize a string, for example turning 'mountain' into 'Mountain'?

There is no built-in method for capitalizing a string. If we wanted to have such a method, we would have to implement it ourselves.
